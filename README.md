Based on the requirements, here is the step-by-step breakdown of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. HTML Structure:
   - index.html: The main HTML file that will contain the structure of the dialog scene and dialog boxes.

2. CSS Styling:
   - style.css: The CSS file that will contain the styles for the dialog scene, dialog boxes, avatars, and text animations.

3. JavaScript Logic:
   - script.js: The JavaScript file that will handle the animations and text appearance for the dialog boxes.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.
